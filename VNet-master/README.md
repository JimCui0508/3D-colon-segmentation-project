# 3DUNet and VNet - Keras

*GMine Cooperation** - *"3D Convolutional Neural Network for colon Segmentation"*



# What I Learned

* Automatic pre-processing algorithm Medical Images in the NIfTI format with NiBabel, SciPy.
* Successfully adapted [VNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797 "V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation") (3D CNN Architecture) to Tensorflow/Keras.
